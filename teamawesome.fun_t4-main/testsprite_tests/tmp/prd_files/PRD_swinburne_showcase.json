    "Error messages are not always surfaced to the user or are too generic.",
    "Redundant API calls and missing loading indicators in some async actions.",
    "No confirmation dialogs for destructive actions (e.g., unfollow, delete project).",
    "Project like/favorite system is not fully implemented or integrated in the UI.",
