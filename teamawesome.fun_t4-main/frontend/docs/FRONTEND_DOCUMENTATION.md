- When you aren't following someone on the `/follow-network` page, the button is displayed as 'Requested' when it should be something that makes more senes.
- 'Failed to create project' on the `/profile` page should be more informative as to error correction.
- The error correction details are not visible in the `/signup` and `\login` pages.
