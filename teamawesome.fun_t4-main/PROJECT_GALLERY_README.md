# Project Gallery Feature Implementation

## Overview
The Project Gallery is a LinkedIn-style feed that displays all public projects from users in the community. It provides a social discovery experience where users can browse projects, see who created them, and interact with content.

## Features

### Core Functionality
- **Public Project Feed**: Displays projects from users with public profiles
- **Pagination**: Load more projects with infinite scroll-style pagination
- **User Information**: Shows creator's name, profile picture, and project creation date
- **Project Details**: Displays project title, description, and images
- **Like System**: Authenticated users can like/unlike projects
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-friendly interface with adaptive layouts

### Authentication Handling
- **Public Access**: Gallery is accessible to all users without login
- **Enhanced Features**: Logged-in users can like projects and see their like status
- **Login Prompts**: Encourages unauthenticated users to log in for full functionality

## Technical Implementation

### Backend Changes

#### New Endpoint
- **Route**: `GET /api/projects/gallery`
- **Controller**: `getPublicProjectGallery` in `projectController.js`
- **Access**: Public (no authentication required)
- **Features**: 
  - Pagination support
  - Only shows projects from public profiles
  - Includes like counts and user like status for authenticated users

#### Database Query
```sql
SELECT 
  p.id, p.title, p.description, p.image_urls, p.created_at, p.user_id,
  u.first_name, u.last_name, u.profile_picture_url,
  COUNT(pl.id) as likes_count,
  CASE WHEN user_likes.user_id IS NOT NULL THEN true ELSE false END as is_liked
FROM projects p
JOIN users u ON p.user_id = u.id
LEFT JOIN project_likes pl ON p.id = pl.project_id
LEFT JOIN project_likes user_likes ON p.id = user_likes.project_id AND user_likes.user_id = $1
WHERE u.is_profile_public = true
GROUP BY p.id, u.first_name, u.last_name, u.profile_picture_url, user_likes.user_id, p.user_id
ORDER BY p.created_at DESC
LIMIT $2 OFFSET $3
```

### Frontend Changes
